                                People who used the internet during the 90s up to the early 2000 will remember this
                                image.
                                When people asked me how long does it take to download a song with dial up internet.
                                I will tell them that it took about one shower section. After school, we like to start
                                the download before we hop in the shower. In reality, it took about 15-20
                                min
                                for a 3 min song.

                            The first time I experience a computer was in 3rd grade around the year 1997. I’m not sure
                            how accurate my memories are, but I do remember playing The Oregon Trail. I am not sure on
                            why we get to play on computers in that class, but it was the best. The Oregon Trail was the
                            best memories I have for elementary school. <br>
                            Now we are going to fast forward to around the year 2000. I remember my dad took me to Best
                            Buy and bought my first computer. It was a
                            Hewlett-Packard with an Intel platinum 4. I did everything with that computer. It allows me
                            to look up answers for homework, and during the time Google wasn’t a thing yet. I used Ask
                            Jeeves for help on math problems, and ...
