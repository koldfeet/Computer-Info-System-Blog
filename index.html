                            why we get to play on computers in that class, but it was the best. The Oregon Trail was the

                            people who perfer Apple, Intel, AMD, and Nvidia. I mostly perfer Intel CPU, Asus
                            motherboard, and Nvidia graphic cards. I also acknowledge that AMD Ryzen and their AMD big
                            navi graphic cards are also really good. With that out of the way, choose what you perfer.

                            In order for a computer to work. It needs to have a total of 3 system software in

                            this... Without the Operating software, the computer is pretty useless to many people.
                            Without the
                            Driver software, computer hardwares will not be useful. Finally, without the Application

                            processes, and how different systems pass messages to each other. This layer is where
                            users interact with the data they received. Here is an example of what is going on
                            in the application layers. Data such as electronic mail when sent needs the
                            SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), then the transport protocol for sent email is TCP 25.

                            The 3 most common ways an average computer user will experience securities risk are
                            phishing, spyware, and virus.
                            An example of phishing is when someone sending fraudulent email to random user hoping that
                            the user will provide personal information that could be used to either take money or sold
                            for money. One example of fraudulent email is the one where it shows that you won a price,
                            BUT you need to send them a check to receive the price. Another example is the IRS (no it is
                            not the IRS) asking you to provide social security numbers because of missing tax
                            information. If it is the IRS, they already have people SSN.
