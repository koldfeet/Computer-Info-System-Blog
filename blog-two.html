        <h1>Voice Editing VS Graphic Design</h1>
        <p>Most computers can achieve many tasks today, but some tasks require extra hardware. When it comes to video
            editing, I prefer a computer with a strong graphic card and a power CPU. The reason why computer that is
            meant to work with graphic design, video editing, and rendering photos all require a graphic card. It
            doesn’t need to be a specific graphic card, but it just needs to have a graphic card. To get deeper into the
            topic, sometime graphic card is important because of the “ray tracing technology.” An example of ray tracing
            is when you trying to build a map and you can see shadow on the ground according to where the light source
            come from, or when a character walked up to a shiny window, and the player can see their characters (or
            other object) reflection. Ray tracing be important for some graphic designer. </p>
        <p>I don’t have experience in sound and voice editing, but after a short Google section shows me that most sound
            engineer require a good sound/audio card. Some also require having a strong graphic card as well if they
            want to incorporate sound to generate graphics like waves or patterns reacting to the sounds. </p>
        <p>When in doubt, look for any computer that is built for gaming. The reason is because gaming computers are
            easily upgradeable, and all of them comes with strong graphic cards and CPU. The RAM nowadays is important,
            but most of the time 16gb of RAM is more than enough to run anything. If 16gb is not enough, you can always
            add another 16gb because the motherboard usually come with 4 DDR4 slots. I haven’t heard of anyone need more
            than 32gb of RAM. </p>
        <p>Storage is very important because it also control how fast you can get the job done. The fast storage today
            is the M.2 memory card. M.2 is faster than an SSD and hundreds of times faster than any traditional hard
            drive. M.2 will boot a computer up almost instantly and doesn’t stutter when accessing and displaying large
            files. </p>
        <p>These are just my recommendation for computers based on price. Sometime, the more money spent the better it
            is. The only question is how good of a computer do you need to get the job done. Sometime paying an extra
            $1000 for an extra 2% of performance is not a good deal. For the best of two worlds, I listed three
            computers with 3 differnet price range that can do both of these tasks. </p>
