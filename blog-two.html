            <h2>Voice Editing VS Graphic Design</h2>
            <hr>
            <h3>
                When it comes to the world of computers, there are a lot of opinions and options.
                There are people who perfer Apple, Intel, AMD, and Nvidia. I mostly perfer Intel CPU,
                Asus motherboard, and Nvidia graphic cards. I also acknowledge that AMD Ryzen and their
                AMD big navi graphic cards are also really good. With that out of the way, choose what
                you perfer. In this day and age, it is hard to buy a bad computer.
            </h3>
            <hr>
            <div class="center-p">
                <p>Most computers can achieve many tasks today, but some tasks require extra hardware. When it comes
                    to
                    video
                    editing, I prefer a computer with a strong graphic card and a power CPU. Computer
                    that is
                    meant to work with graphic design, video editing, and rendering photos all require a graphic
                    card.
                    It
                    doesn’t need to be a specific graphic card, but it just needs to have a graphic card. To get
                    deeper
                    into
                    the
                    topic, graphic card is important because of the ray tracing technology and how fast it come process
                    the image. An example of
                    ray
                    tracing
                    is when you trying to build an environment and you can see shadow on the ground according to where
                    the
                    light
                    source
                    come from, or when a character walked to a shiny window, and the player can see their
                    characters
                    (or
                    other object) reflection. Ray tracing be important for some graphic designer.
                </p>
                <p>I don’t have experience in sound and voice editing, but after a short Google section shows me
                    that
                    most
                    sound
                    engineer require a good sound/audio card. Some also require having a strong graphic card as well
                    if
                    they
                    want to incorporate sound to generate graphics like waves or patterns reacting to the sounds.
                </p>
                <p>When in doubt, look for a computer that is built for gaming. The reason is because gaming
                    computers
                    are
                    easily upgradeable, and all of them comes with strong graphic cards and CPU. The RAM nowadays is
                    important,
                    but most of the time 16gb of RAM is more than enough to run anything. If 16gb is not enough, you
                    can
                    always
                    add another 16gb because the motherboard usually come with 4 DDR4 slots. I haven’t heard of
                    anyone
                    need
                    more
                    than 32gb of RAM yet. </p>
                <p>Storage is very important because it also control how fast you can get the job done. The fastest
                    storage
                    today
                    is the M.2 memory card. M.2 is faster than an SSD and hundreds of times faster than any
                    traditional
                    hard
                    drive. M.2 will boot a computer up almost instantly and doesn’t stutter when accessing and
                    displaying
                    large
                    files. </p>
                <p>These are just my recommendation for computers based on price. Sometime, the more money spent the
                    better
                    it
                    is. The only question is how good of a computer do you need to get the job done. Sometime paying
                    an
                    extra
                    $1000 for an extra 2% of performance is not a good deal, and this is the main reason why I don't
                    perfer Apple. I listed
                    three
                    computers with 3 differnet price range that can do both of these tasks. One of them can product
                    images and video
                    in 4k and the other 2 can do at least 1660p or even 2k.</p>
