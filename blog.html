                            for a few people. The internet was more about getting news, sports, and share
                            information with coworkers. Ecom store and money transfer wasn't a thing yet...

                        <p> The first time I experience a computer was in 3rd grade around the year 1997. I’m not sure
                            how
                            accurate my memories are, but I do remember playing The Oregon Trail. I am not sure on why
                            we
                            get to
                            play on computers in that class, but it was the best. The Oregon Trail was the best memories
                            I
                            have
                            for elementary school.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Now we are going to fast forward to around the year 2000. I remember my dad took me to Best
                            Buy
                            and
                            bought my first computer. It was a Hewlett-Packard with an Intel platinum 4. I did
                            everything
                            with
                            that computer. It allows me to look up answers for homework, and during the time Google
                            wasn’t a
                            thing yet. I used Ask Jeeves for help on math problems, and Yahoo for everything else. There
                            was
                            also Yahooligan (not sure if they’re still around), it was a Yahoo for kids that have many
                            fun
                            games. I still remember chatting with people who I don’t even know for hours every night to
                            midnight
                            in a game room. During that time, I don’t remember the type and level of toxicity that was
                            on
                            the
                            internet compared to nowadays.

                        <p>
                            These are my some of my favorite memories growing up when computer and the internet was
                            still
                            young,
                            but the one that takes the cake must be this one. This happened around my freshman year in
                            high
                            school. For elective I chose this computer class, but I can’t remember what it was. All I
                            remember
                            was that we worked with Adobe Flash MX making animation for one semester and the other we
                            use
                            Adobe
                            Dreamweaver to make a website. My first website was a car website that talks about cars and
                            their
                            spec based off Top Gear reviews. All the nerds who like computer always hang out in that
                            room
                            during
                            lunch, and Mr. Miller was perfectly ok with it. What we love to do after we ate
                            lunch, is
                            to
                            sneak into the parking lot to have a cigarette and back to Mr. Miller classroom. All of us
                            talk
                            about the internet, and this one guy name Anthony. He was a punk, rocker, emo, skater kind
                            of
                            kid.
                            He told us about this software called Bear Share. It was one of those software where you can
                            download just about anything. The only problem with this kind of software is that you need
                            to make
                            sure
                            that
                            the music file you want to download is a MP3 file and not and a .exe.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Bear Share showed me a whole new world within the internet. After that, I discovered
                            LimeWire,
                            and
                            it was the same as Bear Share, but they have a much bigger community and a lot more music
                            and
                            software. I told all the guys about LimeWire during lunch, and this other kid told us about
                            this
                            software where you can download that will find product kyes for just about every popular
                            software.
                            Then we have this idea of having Microsoft Office at home so we can do schoolwork.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We think this is how a products key generator works. The user input the company name and
                            software.
                            Then it runs all possible random combinations of every letter on the keyboard until it finds
                            a
                            product key that “might” work. Usually, 1 in every 7 or 12 product keys that the software
                            generated
                            will work. This led to a competition between all of us to see who can download the most
                            music
                            and
                            have the most software. During the time, I don’t think anyone of us thought about how
                            illegal
                            that
                            was. We used the school internet to download Adobe Dreamweaver and Microsoft window ME onto
                            an
                            external hard drive. Then we go home, and farm for product keys. We love the school internet
                            because
                            it was a million times faster than our Net Zero and AOL dial up at home.

                            Overall, growing up when the internet was young, and innocent was fun. I’ve made long time
                            friends
                            from playing with people in Counter Strike, World of Warcraft, and random people in a chess
                            game
                            chatroom in Yahoo. I also remember my mom friends asking her if our telephone line is
                            broken
                            because of my dial up. It was a whole lot of fun because we were hacking, and we didn’t even
                            know
                            it. To this day, I still wonder if Mr. Miller know what we were doing with the school
                            internet.
                            That
                            was how innocent everything was…

                            The internet during the late 90s and early 2000s was very important because of school and
                            many
                            other
                            businesses depended on it. The only difference between today and the 90s is that the
                            internet
                            work a
                            lot better and a lot faster. Since it is much faster than the 90s, it is more acceptable by
                            businesses. Companies can lose millions if the internet go downs for a few hours, and most
                            companies
                            won’t be able to operate without the internet at all. I think the economy will slow down and
                            production will not be at this level if it wasn’t for the internet. Many professional
                            educators
                            believe that the internet marks the end of the Industrial Revolution, and kick started the
                            new
                            age
                            of information. The internet is a part of almost everyone’s life, whether it’s for
                            entertainment
                            or
                            for business, and without its society might enter a dark age.
